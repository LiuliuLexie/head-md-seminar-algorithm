### Martin Heidegger: The Question Concerning Technology

【summary from [futurelearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/philosophy-of-technology/0/steps/26315#:~:text=As%20we%20just%20heard%2C%20Heidegger's,3)%20technology%20is%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20highest)】

As we just heard, Heidegger’s analysis of technology in The Question Concerning Technology consists of three main ‘claims’: 

(1) technology is “not an instrument”, it is a way of understanding the world; 
(2) technology is “not a human activity”, but develops beyond human control;  
(3) technology is “the highest danger”, risking us to only see the world through technological thinking.

“Technology is not equivalent to the essence of technology. When we are seeking the essence of “tree,” we have to become aware that that which pervades every tree, as tree, is not itself a tree that can be encountered among all the other trees. ……..(Heidegger 4)

【another summary from [https://36kr.com/p/1720972394497](https://36kr.com/p/1720972394497)】

- *技术的本质其实与技术无关；*
- *人类其实是促使一个新技术出现的四个平等要素之一，而并非人类是技术的主人；*
- *技术属于展现的范畴，即技术的本质是使真实得以呈现的一种方式；*
- *现代技术的本质决定了该种呈现方式的终点是危险；*
- *人类需要另外一种呈现方式：艺术*

他认为技术的本质肯定不会是什么和技术相关的东西，这个观点应该继承自亚里[士多](https://36kr.com/project/1678363106456585)德（回复“库尔贝9”阅读《自画像可以把亚里士多德[柏拉图](https://36kr.com/project/1678510601024513)的哲学说明白，这事儿你信不？》）。而正是因为技术的本质与技术无关，所以如果人类愈发依赖技术，愈发认为技术本身是中性的，就愈发难找到技术的本质到底是什么。

如果让你定义“技术”，你会说什么？海德格尔认为无非有两种答案，一种是“技术是为了达到一个目的所使用的手段”；另一种是“技术是一种人类活动。”很显然，这两种定义把人类放在了支配的地位上，人类是技术的主人。但海德格尔似乎不喜欢人类这种自大的态度，相反他将人类与亚里士多德“四因说”里的前三因，即质料因（causa materialis）、形式因（causa formalis）、目的因（causa finalis）放在了平等的位置上。比如一个宗教祭祀中使用的银器是如何产生的呢？你得先有银这种材质，然后还要有容器的形状，然后这个银器出现的目的是在祭祀中使用，最后银器匠作为第四个要素动力因（causa efficiens）出现，这四个要素共同作用产出了银器。读出不同了吗？人类其实是促使一个新技术出现的四个平等要素之一。海德格尔写到这里不禁提问，那到底是什么把这四个要素团结到一块的呢？这个什么恐怕就是技术的本质吧！于是海德格尔给出第一个重要的概念：展现（英语原词是bringing-forth）。

“（那个令四个要素团结到一起的事物）让还没有出现的东西展现出来，这四个要素是在这种展开的控制下把东西展现成它外表看起来的样子。”（"They let what is not yet present arrive into presencing. Accordingly, they are unifiedly ruled over by a bringing that brings what presences into appearance."）

“只有当隐藏的东西不再隐藏，展现才发生。”（"Bringing-forth comes to pass only insofar as something concealed comes into unconcealment."）

如果你明白了上面两句话的逻辑，你就可以明白技术的本质不是手段，技术属于展现（bringing-forth）的范畴，技术是呈现的方式之一。

这里要特别强调一下，与我们通常理解的人类推动了科学发展不同，海德格尔始终认为人类在科技上的任何新想法不过是在回应展现（bringing-forth）给予人类的灵感，即使是柏拉图这样深刻的人也不例外。“从柏拉图开始，真实就是以想法的形式呈现自己，并不是柏拉图将真实展现出来，他只是在回应以想法的形式呈现出来的真实。”（"The fact that the real has been showing itself in the light of Ideas ever since the time of Plato, Plato did not bring about. The thinker only responded to what addressed itself to him."）

个人觉得海德格尔对待现代技术的态度是消极的，特别不喜以精准计算为代表的物理学登上历史舞台后的技术发展。他在这里提出了第二个很重要的概念：被迫展现（英语原词是challenging-forth）。被迫展现（challenging-forth）是展现（bringing-forth）的一种，而这种被迫展现将大自然看作是随时待命、即将枯竭的资源库，人类则成为了没有自主思想、日日做重复劳动的行尸走肉，海德格尔甚至在文中调侃了一下“人力资源”（human resource）这个词！是啊，人类竟然悲惨到成为了被使用的资源...于是，现代技术的发展令人类进入了一个前所未有的悖论：人类自愿又不自愿地参与了被迫展现（challenging-forth）整个过程。

再回到技术的本质来，技术的本质到底是什么？技术的本质就是展现，而海德格尔为现代技术的本质提出了第三个重要概念：框架（英语原词是Enframing）。“框架是（展现）的所有要素的集合，它待人类如随时待命的资源，强迫人类按照一定秩序来展现真实”（"Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve."）现代技术的本质就是这个框架。这个框架令真实被迫展现，令人类不自知地成为帮凶，而可悲的是，人类却自鸣得意地认为自己主宰一切。

不需赘述，你也应该可以体会这个框架的终点其实是危险。于是，海德格尔提出了另外一个问题，真实得以展现的方式是不是只有技术一种？答案是否定的。技术（technology）这个词源自古希腊的techne，而在古希腊语里，techne不仅仅包含技术的意思，还有艺术的意思。艺术是真实得以展现的另外一种方式，这种展现是诗意的。

大哲学家得出的结论就是，科学和艺术是真实得以展现的两种方式，二者缺一不可：如果只用科学来对待世界，那世界的终点可能是危险；如果只用艺术来看待世界呢？或许又是诗意有足，（ ）不足吧！括号里是什么，就由读者你来填写吧！

真实到底该以何种方式呈现其实就是整个人类发展的历史，海德格尔的文章透露着淡淡的无力感，人类虽然参与了真实呈现的全过程，却似乎并无选择呈现什么的权利，现代科技真的就是人的宿命吗？

无论是与不是，我认可海德格尔对艺术重要性的强调，写到这里，我觉得似乎本文结尾可以与题记形成一个完美的闭环，单单依靠语言是无法将真实阐述清楚的，因此我们需要除了语言符号之外的元素，比如绘画、比如电影等；同样的，单单依靠技术呈现出来的真实是危险的，因此我们需要另外一种呈现方式－艺术，而艺术就包括绘画、电影等。

类似观点：

大导[演库](https://36kr.com/project/1678554030306306)布里克说：

> “理性只能带你到达一定边界，越过边界，你若还想前行，你需要诗意，你需要想象力。”
> 

乔布斯更是在20岁出头就看透了这一切，他说：

> “在印度村庄呆了7个月后再回到美国，我看到了西方世界的疯狂以及理性思维的局限。如果你坐下来静静观察，你会发现自己的心灵有多焦躁。如果你想平静下来，那情况只会更糟，但是时间久了总会平静下来，心里就会有空间让你聆听更加微妙的东西 －这时候你的直觉开始发展，你看事情会更加透彻，也更能感受现实的环境。你的心灵逐渐平静下来，你的视野会极大地延伸。你能看到之前看不到的东西。”
> 

心理学家卡尔·荣格在《本能与无意识》（“Psychology of the Unconscious”）里说：

> “有两种思考方式，一种是‘直接关注的思考’，科学与技术的发展依托于此，这也是现代科学精神之母；另外一种是梦境的或者想象的思考，比如梦，比如儿童的想法，就是那些完全自由的，不受限制的主观感受。”
> 

【from wiki about Heidegger】

根据海德格尔的说法，所有至今的哲学蓝图，都是对世界的单向度的理解，这种单向度，他认为是所有形而上学的标志。

按照海德格尔的观点，这种形而上学的对世界的理解，在现代“技术”中达到了顶峰。“技术”这个概念，他不仅理解成一种中性的用来达到目的的手段，而且他试图去展示：通过技术，我们对世界的理解也发生了变化。

根据他的观点，由于技术，我们从实用的角度，去看待地球。由于技术的全球性传播，和毫无节制的对自然资源的利用，海德格尔在技术中看到了一种不可抗拒的危险。

他把艺术看成是技术的对立面，并且从三十年代末开始，他根据[荷尔德林](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8D%B7%E7%88%BE%E5%BE%B7%E6%9E%97)的诗，领会到了对于单纯的技术性的世界关联方式的替代方式。

海德格尔曾尝试引领哲学家脱离[形而上学](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BD%A2%E8%80%8C%E4%B8%8A%E5%AD%B8)及[知识论](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9F%A5%E8%AD%98%E8%AB%96)的问题而朝向[本体论](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%AC%E9%AB%94%E8%AB%96)的问题。这就是[存在](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%98%E5%9C%A8)的意义。

我的问题点：

- 技术和人的关系， 海德格尔-技术的出现源于人对感召的反应，那仍然是先人-技术，然后技术不受控于人，那如果技术一直受控于人，将会如何，技术的弊端还存在/是一个问题吗
- Leo Marx and Martin Heidegger, 很相似的观点是 they both agree that technology is in most time not a thing, that means, a point. 它是一个过程/一个通道，一种达到目的和展现的手段

### 0125 class notes

difference between technology and something technological?

### **Heidegger**

essence of technology

people define technology: a means to an end, a human activity; ends - a tool, human activity - technique

tékhnē (greek) - art, craft

tékhnē is a related concept to episteme (to think) and poiesis (activity by which a person brings something into the world)

for Heidegger: technology means make or do something in order to know

revealing 

more than human activity, it kinds of open itself up for the human beings 

technology is a mode of revealing or bringing-forth

technology reveals enframing, or a framwork

capture the essence of technology

### Marx

Leo Marx: The Machine in the Garden - very foundational historical research of technology

technology as a semantic signifier of progress

progress used to mean something else

technology is ideological 

“Technology” as a concept often refers to socio-technical systems rather than machines or objects, like we talk about apple instead of ios or apps

a hazardous thing that we can’t really rely on

apple: ad of apple tv and iphone : selling a lifestyle brand

### Langdon Winner: “Do Artifacts Have Politics?”

【[a reflection by Imola](https://francescoimola.medium.com/do-artifacts-have-politics-by-langdon-winner-a-reflection-bde891f9f546) + my addition】

Langdon Winner is a political theorist whose work focuses on contemporary political thought, race, technology, and social theory. **“Do Artifacts Have Politics?”** is a journal article by Winner published in 1980 where he first claims that **artifacts, intended as technical objects, have political properties and embody forms of authority and subordination. Winner suggests that we pay close attention to the properties of the technologies surrounding us and the meaning of those properties**.

Winner provides examples of technical systems which at first sight may not explicitly express any form of political intent. But have, in reality, been designed to produce concrete social consequences. See the [parkways erected around Long Island by Robert Moses in the 1930s](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.citylab.com%2Ftransportation%2F2017%2F07%2Fhow-low-did-he-go%2F533019%2F&t=MzU1ZmM0YzM3ZmFlNDU5OTcxODMwMjU5ZGI0MzdmMTk3YWM1OTE2OCxyVTNhWVFMaw%3D%3D&b=t%3A7i2oBI-PG-mstQuYKRxyCw&p=https%3A%2F%2Ffrancescoimola.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178662822946%2Fdo-artifacts-have-politics-by-langdon-winner-a&m=1) and [the introduction of the Mechanical Tomato Harvester in 1949](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fboomcalifornia.com%2F2013%2F06%2F24%2Fthinking-through-the-tomato-harvester%2F&t=NDhiYjU3ZjY2ZWI4NjUzZTljM2RiMjI1NzY4NmZkOTgyODA5N2E1NixyVTNhWVFMaw%3D%3D&b=t%3A7i2oBI-PG-mstQuYKRxyCw&p=https%3A%2F%2Ffrancescoimola.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178662822946%2Fdo-artifacts-have-politics-by-langdon-winner-a&m=1).

- add: Robert Moses, master builder of roads, parks…. and other public works from 1920s to 1970s. social-class bias and racial prejudice; technical developments at McCormick factory, the destruction of the union; tomato harvester, industrialized our food supply and displaced field labor in California, “grow for the machine,” 有点像Heidegger说的beyond human control，人类被迫展现和适应机器

These examples prove how some technologies have, from the outset, been deployed to discriminate, pose threats, and maintain a regime of power where skilled leaders are those making choices. Workers are not given the right to participate in the decision-making process, which rules how technology influences the way people connect with each other.

While **some artifacts are *widely believed* to require social structures in which those can operate, others are thought to work well *in conjunction* *with 协同* specific systems of power and authority** (Winner, 1980). However, Winner states that （a “both/and” position） **certain technologies are inherently autocratic and *must* require particular social structures for their implementation. The atom bomb is one of those. On the other hand, solar power is far more decentralized and doesn’t represent a security risk — it is inherently democratic and populist** (Innovation Group, University of California, n.d.).

### Thomas Hughes: “Technological Momentum ” in *Does Technology Drive History?*

momentum 冲力；推动力

【from wiki】

The metaphor of momentum is often used in relation to technological innovation and, more specifically, **to claim that an emerging technology is gaining relevance and is edging towards commercialization**

**Technological momentum** is a theory about the relationship between [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) and [society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society) over time. The term, which is considered a fourth technological determinism variant,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_momentum#cite_note-:0-1) was originally developed by the [historian of technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_technology) [Thomas P. Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_P._Hughes). The idea is that relationship between technology and society is reciprocal and time-dependent so that one does not determine the changes in the other but both influence each other.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_momentum#cite_note-2)

Hughes's thesis is a synthesis of two separate models for how technology and society interact. 

One, [***technological determinism***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism), claims that society itself is modified by the introduction of a new technology in an irreversible and irreparable way—for example, the introduction of the [automobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile) has influenced the manner in which [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America) cities are designed, a change that can clearly be seen when comparing the pre-automobile cities on the East Coast to the post-automobile cities on the West Coast. Technology, under this model, self-propagates 自我传播 as well—there is no turning back once the adoption has taken place, and the very existence of the technology means that it will continue to exist in the future. （link to tomato harvester 技术没有回头路，相当于一个不完善的技术的出现，人工顺应，人工被迫适应不完善技术然后共同发展）

The other model, **[*social determinism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinism)**, claims that society itself controls how a technology is used and developed—for example, the rejection of [nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power) technology in the USA amid the public fears after the [Three Mile Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident) incident.

*Technological momentum* takes the two models and adds *time* as the unifying factor. In Hughes's theory, when a technology is young, deliberate control over its use and scope is possible and enacted by society. However, as a technology matures, and becomes increasingly enmeshed in the society where it was created, its own deterministic force takes hold, achieving technological momentum in the process. According to Hughes this inertia, which is particularly the case for large technological systems with their technological and social components, makes them difficult to influence and steer as they start to go more on their own way, assuming deterministic traits in the process.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_momentum#cite_note-:0-1) In other words, Hughes's says that the relationship between technology and society always starts with a *social determinism* model, but evolves into a form of *technological determinism* over time and as its use becomes more prevalent and important.

Since its introduction by Hughes, the *technological momentum* concept has been applied by a number of other historians of technology.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_momentum#cite_note-3) For instance, it is considered **an effective approach to reconciling the apparently opposite perspectives of the autonomy of technology and the social and political motivations behind technological choices.**[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_momentum#cite_note-4) It is able to describe **how socially and politically conditioned technological institutions become independent and autonomous over time.**

### 0130 class notes

technological determinism vs social constructivism (of technology)

### Langdon Winner: “Do Artifacts Have Politics?”

Lewis Mumford: Technologies are either authoritarian or democratic?

Technology is usually cast as a democratic good, a great equalizer upon its emergence.

Determinism vs constructivism + politics (politics related to or built into themselves??) >>>link to Marx: technology developing and human beings responding

Two types of political considerations:

- Instances in which technology is used to address a political issue
- Inherently political technologies

Politics, for winner, is the arrangement of power and authority in culture and the activities that happen within that arrangement.

Technical arrangements as forms of order - first type:

- the bus example, robert moses
- chicago factory example, bust labor movement
- tomato picker machine
- anti-homeless architecture

Inherently political technologies, two way to argue this:

- technologies structure and produce certain forms of control (the factory, the ship, etc.)
- technology seem to lend themselves to certain political structures (nuclear tech)

This is intended to be empowering. >>> Marx: ideological, human being’s interruption 

### Thomas Hughes: “Technological Momentum ” in *Does Technology Drive History?*

ex. utility platforms, two directions development; COVID, broad extension of technology based on existing technologies

technological systems as creating or gathering momentum

iron cage or not? Irresistible?

technological momentum - another way …

group discussion: an example tech: the disappearance of cash/ cashless payment

- intervening in a political (public) or inherently political technology? we think both. 1. increase the wealth gap, workload for the workers, excludes some people that cannot do digital payment 2. personal data recorded
- technological or social side? we think both. easier access to all stores and easy for life

### Bruno Latour: “Morality and Technology”

【[journal by Emiljtlao](https://beyondsociology.wordpress.com/2014/03/17/bruno-latour-morality-and-technology-the-end-of-the-means/)】

Main question:  We conceive of morality as this universal rationality, this inborn sense of obligation and honor, yet Latour means to show that **morality may be seen as the subjective(?) response to technology’s multiplying mediators**–am I not understanding his position correctly, or this still falling into the trap of “technology is neutral, it just depends on how you use it that determines its ethics” or is it somehow more radical since technology has created possibilities we don’t even conceive of, and morality must concern itself with those possibilities that we don’t recognize?

Technology is commonly viewed as the means to the ends, which is the distinct domain of morality.  Latour aims to show that technology is its own modes of existence, and not merely an addition to human beings but rather as integral to humans as is morality.  If the tool has even preceded the evolution of humanity, then we must not treat technology so lightly as either neutral (morality dictates whether it is right or wrong) or simply a means to an end.  In fact, technology multiplies the intermediaries and mediators involved, radically shifting the ends and presenting new possibilities, that may or may not be related to the original objective for which the technology was implemented.  We have become ‘the figure of the labrynth’, that must endure multiple techniques, methods that are liable to folds (the concertina) and detours.  **Folds** being all of the hidden materialities/geneologies of the technology (it’s physical sources and their concrescence as well as the various evolving purposes of the technology over time), and **detours** being the necessary steps an individual takes to orient with the technology before their original objectives can be met (in this sense it is a curve rather than a straight line to get to the destination).  褶皱是技术的所有隐藏的物质/基因（它的物理来源和它们的具体化，以及随着时间的推移技术的各种演变的目的），而迂回是个人在他们的原始目标得以实现之前，为适应技术而采取的必要步骤（在这个意义上，这是一条曲线，而不是一条到达目的地的直线）。 Latour draws upon Marcel Mauss’s ‘technique of the body’ to show that technology is not superficial, but penetrates the deep moral habits of the body.  This might be seen as the ‘under-ego’ of technologies that force certain behaviors on us (like Latour’s drawers that only open in a particular way, fashioned by a maker that has imposed his will on the the desks’ users).

This is where Latour changes the notion of technology and morality from being-as-being to being-as-other, that is, neither technology nor morality are concerned with stagnation, since technology inherently multiplies possibility, and morality must constantly re-evaluate those new mediations technology has brought to it, therefore there are separate modes of existence yet in constant co-evolution.  Morality is constantly concerned with these beings-as-others, insofar as they represent various means to ends.

这就是拉图尔将技术和道德的概念从 "作为存在 "改变为 "作为其他"，也就是说，技术和道德都不关心停滞不前，因为技术本身就会增加可能性，而道德必须不断地重新评估技术带给它的那些新的中介，因此存在着独立的存在模式，但又在不断地共同演化。 道德不断关注这些作为他者的存在，因为他们代表了达到目的的各种手段。

### Walter Benjamin: “The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility”

【[summary from Mehdi](https://medium.com/@shahbazmehdi/summary-the-work-of-art-in-the-age-of-its-technological-reproducibility-ea073a48cc2b)】

This essay by Walter Benjamin, published in 1936, sheds light on **the impact of mass production on the work of Art and its traditional and individual uniqueness**.
Published in 1936, Benjamin’s dissertation on the work of art is a discussion on the value of art and the influence of its technological reproduction on the capitalists and society. He also mentions Marx analysis on the capitalist mode of production during the industrial revolution; that discusses what could be expected in future of the capitalist production, that is — the profiteering of the lower-class as well as the dissolution of capitalism. The influence of the technological reproduction of the work of art tends to play a significant role on the cultural and political values of the society and fascists. Where politicians used the art as a means of growing their political agenda into the people of society and controlled the exhibition as to convey only the messages and methods convenient to their ambitions. Society perceived art as a unique instrument of traditional values. The reproduction of art can contribute in manipulating the credible material in the favour of the fascists but on the other hand, it can be beneficial in the revolution of politics of art. 

艺术品复制的便利-1. 政治宣传+言论控制（自上而下）；2. 革命（自下而上）

所以本质上感觉还是，路径/工具的拓宽，就是上到下，下到上，路径都宽了，只要能破门，就能使用

技术-意识（形态）

While people have always been able to replicate art through various methods since prehistoric ages. Upon the study of the history of art, it can be observed how humankind has progressed from cave paintings to writing on stones and later to etching on wood blocks. Art has always been reproduced through one way or another, sometimes for the pupil’s artistic exercise purposes, master’s exhibition of his work or for profiteers. Technological reproduction was something new, wood-cut being one of the earliest technique used in the reproduction of art, contested later in the nineteenth century by lithography. 

那不就是print吗printmaking

Lithography advanced the reproduction of art by means of numbers as well as variations. This led graphic art take its place in the everyday and domestic life of the society under the influence of materialism. A decade later, the invention of photography competed well in meeting such demands of society. Photography drew the hand of artist away from the canvas as it relied only upon the use of the eye as the tool. Indeed what could be drawn by hand could now be captured in a few moments, more swiftly through the lens of the camera. This accelerated the reproduction of art to a much higher speed and drive art into its manipulative properties. 

平板印刷-摄影：加速复制速度，使艺术有可操纵性manipulative properties

A painting or image within its original form and state holds certain uniqueness of its history, which Benjamin describes as **the ‘aura’ of art**. This aura is the only and rare quality that surrounds art with its emotional and historical beliefs. In ‘The Salon of 1859’, Charles Baudelaire describes photography as “… art’s most mortal enemy, …” (Baudelaire, n.d.). Although a photograph captures the moment in more accurate and swift way, is only the reflection of the moment, which can be altered by the means of lens and viewpoint during reproduction. This reproduction lacks the traditional value and historical proof of its existence in its original form. Benjamin states “In even the most perfect reproduction, one thing is lacking: the here and now of the work of art — its unique existence in a particular place” (Benjamin, 1936). A painting when drawn can have a cultural or emotional attachment between the artist and the subject and what the artist feels about it at that time. But on the other hand, the photograph of the same subject can be adjusted and welded for a different audience at different times portraying different meanings, losing its original ‘aura’. “If photography is allowed to complement art in some of its functions, the latter will soon be ousted and ruined by it …” (Baudelaire, n.d.).

？有点怪，那难道绘画就不会被adjusted by different audience吗？？

The essence of originality in a work of art often lies in its tradition; which is lost with its reproduction. A painting made by an artist in a certain context of tradition, ritual and historical means may be of entirely different context in a reproduced copy present under different circumstances at a different place. It is not only about the art but also the imagery we see or the sounds we hear in a film that create an artificial or contextual perception as per the demands of the producer. In theatres, the audience witnessed the one and true form of a performance and actors performed naturally and in a way that pleased their audience. This could now be edited, manipulated and re-acted upon many times for the best shot under the orders of the directors. The audience now, in this context is your camera man, director and few more people that aid in recording and the real viewers await the manipulated release to be enjoyed privately at home.

**The effect of manipulation and mass production on an original artwork or on its ‘aura’** is the major discussion point for Benjamin in his essay. His predictions of this impact state two points — **Firstly, the art will lose it’s uniqueness and value under the influence of mass production. Secondly, how this mass production of art can influence and drive the society out of the prowess of capitalism.**

操纵和大规模生产对原始艺术品或其 "光环 "的影响是本雅明在其文章中的主要讨论点。他对这种影响的预测有两点：第一，在大规模生产的影响下，艺术将失去它的独特性和价值。第二，这种艺术的大规模生产如何影响和推动社会脱离资本主义的威力。

【[from wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction)】

"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1935), by Walter Benjamin, is an essay of cultural criticism which proposes and explains that mechanical reproduction devalues the aura (uniqueness) of an objet d'art.[1] That in the age of mechanical reproduction and the absence of traditional and ritualistic value, the production of art would be inherently based upon the praxis of politics. Written during the Nazi régime (1933–1945) in Germany, Benjamin presents a theory of art that is "useful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics of art" in a mass-culture society.[2]

The subject and themes of Benjamin's essay: 

- the aura of a work of art;
- the artistic authenticity of the artefact;
- its cultural authority;
- and the aestheticization of politics for the production of art,

became resources for research in the fields of art history and architectural theory, cultural studies and media theory.

## Summary

In "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1935) Walter Benjamin presents the thematic basis for a theory of art by quoting the essay "The Conquest of Ubiquity" (1928), by [Paul Valéry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Val%C3%A9ry), to establish how works of art created and developed in past eras are different from contemporary works of art; that the understanding and treatment of art and of artistic technique must progressively develop in order to understand a work of art in the context of the modern time.

> Our fine arts were developed, their types and uses were established, in times very different from the present, by men whose power of action upon things was insignificant in comparison with ours. But the amazing growth of our techniques, the adaptability and precision they have attained, the ideas and habits they are creating, make it a certainty that profound changes are impending in the ancient craft of the Beautiful. In all the arts there is a physical component which can no longer be considered or treated as it used to be, which cannot remain unaffected by our modern knowledge and power. For the last twenty years neither matter nor space nor time has been what it was from time immemorial. We must expect great innovations to transform the entire technique of the arts, thereby affecting artistic invention itself and perhaps even bringing about an amazing change in our very notion of art.[5]

### **Artistic production[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction&action=edit&section=2)]**

In the Preface to the essay, Benjamin presents Marxist analyses of the organisation of a capitalist society and of the place of [the arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts) in a capitalist society, both in the [public sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere) and in the [private sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sphere); and explains the socio-economic conditions of society to extrapolate future developments of capitalism that will result in the [economic exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour) of the proletariat, and so will produce the socio-economic conditions that would abolish capitalism. By reviewing the historical and technological developments of the mechanical means for reproducing a work of art, Benjamin establishes that artistic reproduction is not a modern human activity, such as the industrial arts of the [foundry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundry) and the [stamp mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_mill) in [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece) [12th–9th c. BC], and the modern arts of [woodcut relief-printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodcut) and [engraving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraving), [etching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etching), [lithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography), and [photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography), which are industrial techniques of [mass production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production) that permit greater accuracy in the mechanical reproduction of a work of art than would an artist manually reproducing an artefact created by a master artist.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-6)

### **Authenticity[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction&action=edit&section=3)]**

The *aura* of a work of art derives from [authenticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticity_(philosophy)) (uniqueness) and locale (physical and cultural); Benjamin explains that "even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: Its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be" located. That the "sphere of [artistic] [authenticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticity_in_Art) is outside the technical [sphere]" of mechanised reproduction.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-benart-7) Therefore, in being unique, the original work of art is an *objet d’art* independent of the mechanically accurate reproduction; yet, by changing the cultural context of where the artwork is located, the existence of the mechanical copy (an art-product) diminishes the aesthetic value of the original work of art. In that way, the *aura* — the unique [aesthetic authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_(textual_criticism)) of a work of art — is absent from the mechanically produced copy.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-8)

### **Value: cult and exhibition[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction&action=edit&section=4)]**

Regarding the social functions of an [artefact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_artifact), Benjamin said that "Works of art are received and valued on different planes. Two polar types stand out; with one, the accent is on the [cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult) value; with the other, on the exhibition value of the work. Artistic production begins with ceremonial objects destined to serve in a cult. One may assume that what mattered was their existence, not their being on view."[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-9) The cult value of [religious art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_art) is in the fact that "certain statues of gods are accessible only to the priest in the [*cella*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cella); certain [madonnas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(art)) remain covered nearly all year round; certain sculptures on medieval cathedrals are invisible to the spectator on ground level."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-10) In practice, the diminished cult value of a religious artefact (an [icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon) no longer venerated) increases the exhibition value of the artefact as art created for the spectators' appreciation, because "it is easier to exhibit a portrait bust, that can be sent here and there [to museums], than to exhibit the statue of a divinity that has its fixed place in the interior of a temple."[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-11)

The mechanical reproduction of a work of art voids its cult value, because removal from a fixed, private space (a temple) and placement in mobile, public space (a museum) allows exhibiting the work of art to many spectators.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-12) Further explaining the transition from cult value to exhibition value, Benjamin said that in "the photographic image, exhibition value, for the first time, shows its superiority to cult value."[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-13) In emphasising exhibition value, "the work of art becomes a creation with entirely new functions," which "later may be recognized as incidental" to the original purpose for which the artist created the *objet d’art*.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-14)

As a medium of artistic production, the [cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) (moving pictures) does not create cult value for the motion picture, itself, because "the audience's identification with the actor is really an [identification with the camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze). Consequently, the audience takes the position of the camera; [the audience's] approach is that of testing. This is not the approach to which cult values may be exposed." Therefore, "the film makes the cult value recede into the background, not only by putting the public in the position of the critic, but also by the fact that, at the movies, this [critical] position requires no attention."[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-15)

### **Art as politics[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction&action=edit&section=5)]**

The social value of a work of art changes as a society change their value systems; thus the changes in artistic styles and in the [cultural tastes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_(sociology)) of the public follow "the manner in which human sense-perception is organized [and] the [artistic] medium in which it is accomplished [are] determined not only by Nature, but by historical circumstances, as well."[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-benart-7)

Despite the negative effects (social, economic, cultural) of [mass-produced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production) art-products upon the *aura* of the original work of art, Benjamin said that "the uniqueness of a work of art is inseparable from its being embedded in the fabric of tradition", which separates the original work of art from the reproduction.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-benart-7) Moreover, Benjamin noted that the [ritualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritualization) of the mechanical reproduction of art also emancipated "the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual",[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-benart-7) thereby increasing the social value of exhibiting works of art; a social and cultural practice that has progressed from the [private sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sphere) of life (the owner's enjoyment of the aesthetics of the artefacts, usually high art) to the [public sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere) of life, wherein the public enjoy the same aesthetics in a gallery displaying works of art.

## Influence[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction&action=edit&section=6)]

In the late-twentieth-century television program [*Ways of Seeing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing) (1972), [John Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berger) proceeded from and developed the themes of "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1935), to explain the contemporary [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(arts)) of [social class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class) and [racial caste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste) inherent to the politics and production of art. That in transforming a work of art into a [commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity), the modern means of artistic production and of artistic reproduction have destroyed the [aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic), cultural, and political [authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_(sociology)) of art: "For the first time ever, images of art have become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free," because they are commercial products that lack the *aura* of authenticity of the original [*objet d'art*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objet_d%27art).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction#cite_note-16)

## What is Media? What is Mediation?

### 0206 Reading & class notes

### Entries on ["Media"](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/262179/topics/8277279) and ["Mediation"](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/262179/topics/8277280) from *Keywords* by Raymond Williams

Raymond Williams: cultural socialist, fiction author, marxism thinker, 20c thinker about media & television

**Media:** the middle

> **Medium**, from *medium,* L – middle, has been in regular use in English from
1C16, and from at latest eC17 has had the sense of an intervening or intermediate
agency or substance. 
**Media** became widely used when broadcasting
as well as the press had become important in communications (q.v.); it was then
the necessary general word, mass (q.v.) **media, media people, media agencies,
media studies** followed.” (151)
> 

the thing that being mediated is one thing to go to the public, 1对多, widely broadcast

three senses of media: 151

(i) the old general sense of an intervening or intermediate agency or substance; 

(ii) the conscious technical sense, as in the distinction between print and sound and vision as **media**; 

remediation

(iii) the specialized capitalist sense, in which a newspaper or broadcasting service – some-thing that already exists or can be planned – is seen as a medium for something else, such as advertising. 

provide platforms for other things like selling goods

media practices

media as technical

media as material forms and systems of signs: material objects? right. systems of signs: language(?), code

media has a direct relationship to communication

media has its own specific and determining properties

**Mediation:** divide in half, occupy a middle position, act as intermediary

“ Thus two of the earliest examples of the use of **mediation** in English, both from Chaucer, carry two of the three main senses which became established: 

(i) interceding between adversaries, with a strong sense of reconciling them – ‘By the popes mediacion…they been acorded’ (*Man of Law ‘s Tale,* c. 1386); 

(ii) a means of transmission, or agency as a medium – ‘By mediacion of this litel tretis, I purpose to teche .’ (*Astrolabe,* c. 1391). From c. 1425 the third early sense, now obsolete, is recorded:

(iii) division or halving – ‘mediacion is a takyng out of halfe a nombre out of a holle nombre’.” (152)

### “[Genesis of the Media Concept](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/262179/topics/8323801)” by John Guillory

“The medium through which works of art continue to influence later ages is always different from the one in which they affect their own age. —WALTER BENJAMIN1” 

what media are? where did it come from? how it as a concept in history? and around several other concepts? >>similar to Marx essay function

> “This essay is an attempt to give an account of this genesis within the longer
history of reflection on communication.
> 

> It is not my purpose, then, to enter into current debates in media theory
but to describe the philosophical preconditions of media discourse. I argue
that the concept of a medium of communication was absent but *wanted* for
the several centuries prior to its appearance, a lacuna in the philosophical
tradition that exerted a distinctive pressure, as if from the future, on early
efforts to theorize communication.” (321)
> 

Aristotle? + Mimesis(art is trying to capture something in the reality): mimesis need a mediation

Remediation: 

> Remediation makes the medium as such *visible*. The early modern period saw the first truly major practice of remediation with the invention of printing, which reproduced the content of manuscript writing at the same time that it opened up new possibilities for writing in the print medium. Still, the transposition of writing into print did not elicit at first a theoretical recognition of media as much as a reflection on the latency of print in the technology of writing itself. It was as though print were there, already, in the medium of writing. “ (324)
> 

remediation changes the character of the content

Evolving terms related to media concept: 

persuasion, communication, means, medium, media, mediation, representation

Rhetoric and Oration

Print/Writing, allows for “communication” rather than only “rhetoric”

Words + language - medium or not? argued by Technology, Distance, and Code (they’re developing through technological means)

For Locke, it would be correct to say that words are the medium of thought, whereas for Wilkins, one must say that writing is the medium of speech.

> the statement “no, that is not what I meant” is the necessary warrant for credibility in communication, evenallowing that once spoken or once written, words acquire the darkness of the medium, which properly draws attention to its opacity.”
> 

representation and media - see highlight 353

> “Misunderstandings are the medium in which the noncommunicable is communicated.” (362)

“media determine our situation” preface

media “define what really is”: they are always already beyond aesthetics

Lacan’s schema: the real, the symbolic, and the imaginary - the mirror self

For Kittle: gramophone = real, film = imaginary, and typewriter = symbolic

keywords: transmission, storage, signal 

Kittler is big on the real, or put a different way that’s not exactly the same: the material.

Kittler loves the analog

Daedalus - episteme/embodiment

> Daedalus is our best eponym for techniqae-and the concept of daedalion our best tool to penetrare the evolution of civilization. His path leads through three disciplines: philosophy, sociology, genealogy.
> 

he is interested in how technology unfolds our relationship with mediation, technology is already a mediator, even not functioning as a specific media

“No unmediated action is possible when we enter the realm of engineers and craftsmen” (29) - engineering and arts

Mediation with technology

**First meaning of mediation: Translation(the gaps)**

![translation.png](Media,%20Technology%20and%20Society%20ff788f33551a40cab3d3ebe96bf6914d/translation.png)

agents - interruptions - goals(the gaps)

- new possibilities of outcomes, goals are afforded

NRA example

agents, or actants can be both human and nonhuman

agents: subjects; actants: more individual actions

**Second meaning of mediation: Composition**

![composition.png](Media,%20Technology%20and%20Society%20ff788f33551a40cab3d3ebe96bf6914d/composition.png)

action is the thing that connects different actants

technical mediation is the action that take place through the relation between different actants

what’s mediated in technical mediation is the technical possibilities afforded by any actants

symmetry 对称性 holds in the case of fabrication as in the case of use

**Third meaning of mediation: Reversible Blackboxing**

![blackboxing.png](Media,%20Technology%20and%20Society%20ff788f33551a40cab3d3ebe96bf6914d/blackboxing.png)

the Blackbox ( + reverse blackboxing)

Blackboxing: 

a process that makes the joint production of actors and artifacts entirely opaque. (36) “使参与者和工件的联合生产完全不透明的过程”

Reverse blackboxing: 

working backward to understand how actors act with each other during the process

Objects are a series of actions and processes. These processes (techniques) produce meaning. This is a reworking of philosophy.

**Fourth meaning of mediation: Delegation 委派；委托**

![4.png](Media,%20Technology%20and%20Society%20ff788f33551a40cab3d3ebe96bf6914d/4.png)

the 2nd action act upon the first - inscription

technical mediation proceeds a kind of shifting. 

humans and nonhumans are collaborators with equal ontological 本体论的；存在论的 weight (way of being). 

![5.png](Media,%20Technology%20and%20Society%20ff788f33551a40cab3d3ebe96bf6914d/5.png)

flows

humanism: all things happen with technology are about human goals

anitihumanism: …technology - ends without ends

Rather than society, we should speak of a collective that includes nonhumans.

![6.png](Media,%20Technology%20and%20Society%20ff788f33551a40cab3d3ebe96bf6914d/6.png)

This is a reworking of sociology.

Defining Technical Mediation:

“Technical mediation, which we are now prepared to summarize: Technical mediation is a form of delegation that allows us to mobilize, during interactions, moves made elsewhere, earlier, by other actants.” (52)

“Responsibility for action must be shared, symmetry restored, and humanity redescribed: not as the sole transcendent cause, but as the mediating mediator” (54)

![7.png](Media,%20Technology%20and%20Society%20ff788f33551a40cab3d3ebe96bf6914d/7.png)

“at the very least, I hope to have convinced you that, if our challenge, is to be met, it will not be met by considering artifacts as things. they deserve better, the deserve to be housed in our intellectual culture as full-fledged social actors. they mediate our actions? no, they are us.”

### “[Introduction](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/262179/topics/8277283)” from *Paper Knowledges* by Lisa Gitelman

Documents exist in order to document. Or, in other words, to know-show.

documenting: practice

document as genre: sf, report, application, etc.

> So tickets, receipts, and business cards count as things at the same time that they count as subgenres of the document; they are patterns of expression and reception discernible amid a jumble of discourse, but they are also familiar material objects to be handled—to be shown and saved, saved and shown—in different ways (3)
> 

Documents are conditioned by the affordances and functions of paper.

paper allows us to capture things, but also a material that easy to destroyed. requires set of practices

Documents frame information along various contexts.

frame in ways that are suitable to particular forms of paper

Documents are important not because they are unbiquitous 普遍存在的，无所不在的… but rather because they are so evidently integral to the ways people think and live.

Documents and authority

stamps from organization or brand, presenting kind of authority or have been built on some rules, is important..

> Documents are integral to the ways people think as well as to the so- cial order that they inhabit. Knowing-showing, in short, can never be disentangled from power—or, more properly, control.16 Documents be- long to that ubiquitous subcategory of texts that embraces the subjects and instruments of bureaucracy or of systematic knowledge generally.

Documents and Print Culture

Paper documents help us to understand digital documents and digital documents reveal assumptions about paper document.

it’s really an enclosed, private, booklike self that we cling to and long for and fear losing, the self that, we might say, romanticism created, that the concept of childhood has kept alive, and that we imagine has been stored and preserved for us in the codex form. (174)

about some of the assumptions made about the tradition of European painting 1400-1900

**Episode 1**

ways of seeing depends much on habit and convention

perspective centers everything on the eye of the beholder

tradition of art calls the appearance travel in to eye reality

perspective make human eye the center of visible world

however, appearance is in constant movement

camera: changing painting

突破painting的空间和时间限制and reproduce them

original painting like 壁画 things around it, the place is also its meaning, it also marks the place with meaning as an icon. the meaning lose when be in other places

the image of painting travels now, become information of a sort

original paintings are still unique

reproductions restort

market value of original painting

religiosity, culture, civilization: a substitute for what paintings lost during the reproduction

reproduction: lost and gain

original painting: silence and still, measuring time themselves

easy to manipulate and transport by adding movement and sound

another changing way: carry information, be surrounded by information, things before and after it

reproduction make it easier to connect experience with art with other experiences 

mystifications 神秘化

resort to meaningless generalisations

life’s virtual forces

children’s eye(before forced to accept the mystifictions), example of Caravaggio‘s painting

next 3, directly elate experience of art to other experiences

**Episode 2**

男性与女性之间的凝视与反凝视关系

man look at women, women watch themselves being looked at 

女人从小被教育的对自己的不断审视

European culture, the success of women is to be a sight to be looked at

in painting, a nude has been seen as an object

two key points of the story of 亚当和夏娃

- nakedness is created in the mind of 旁观者
- woman is punished, man becomes the agents 代理人 of god

in European tradition, nude implies awareness to be seen by the audience. they are not naked as they are, they are naked as you seen

man see naked women and judge them

nude judged as sights

nakedness is not a expression of her own feelings, instead, a sign

a second person in oil painting: a man looking at the woman but the woman not looking at him or look out of the painting 

the picture matters with his sexual passion instead of hers

women show limited passion and always lies

nude presented as an ideal subject

is there sexuality in the frame or in front of them? 

in film, photography…

both man and woman are narcissistic but in different senses

女人对自己的形象directly get from others and man gets from the world because he act a role in it

woman is more passive because her usually directly lead to a person

relates to identity

**Episode 3**

look and buy and collect valuable things

the most valuable thing becomes oil painting

buy a painting, also meaning but the look that the things represents

paintings show treasures and become treasures themselves

Where does the mysterious value of painting come from?

reproduction, king of, de-mysterize the value 

wary the love of art

the paintings, before they are anything else, they are unique objects that can be sold and bought

food, animals, portraits (records of the confidence of those to whom ownership brought confidence; wealth and power), cloth, landscape painting 

the tradition can breed within itself a counter-tradition, but the basic values of the tradition win in the end.

we study other cultures far away as anthropology, from the outside 

if we view oil painting, before everything else, it is a medium which celebrated private possessions

"Camera Lucida"是一本由法国文化批评家罗兰·巴特（Roland Barthes）所写的书，讨论了照相的本质和影响。这本书被认为是20世纪最重要的摄影理论著作之一。

- 书中的第一部分主要探讨了照相对于时间和死亡的关系。巴特认为照片有一种特殊的力量，它可以捕捉住时间的瞬间，将它们永远定格在一张纸上。但是，随着时间的推移，这些照片也逐渐失去了它们最初的意义和价值。因此，照相既是对时间的一种记录，也是对时间的一种毁灭。
- 巴特还提到了一种称为"punctum"的概念，这是一种在照片中引起人们共鸣或触动的特定细节或元素。每个人对于照片中的punctum的理解和感受都可能不同，因为它与个人的经历、文化和背景有关。

第一部分，也就是"Reflections on Photography"，主要探讨了照相对于时间、死亡和个人记忆的关系。巴特认为，照片的存在是一种时间的证明，因为照片可以定格并记录下特定时刻的事物。但是，随着时间的推移，这些照片也会逐渐失去它们的价值和意义，因为它们不再反映当时的情境和背景。此外，巴特还介绍了一种概念，叫做"punctum"，这是照片中的某个元素或细节，能够引起观看者强烈的共鸣和感觉，每个人对这些元素的感受和理解都可能不同。

第二部分，也就是"Typology of Photographs"，则探讨了不同类型的照片和它们的意义。巴特将照片分为两种类型："studium"和"punctum"。"studium"是指照片中的整体环境和情境，是被照片所呈现的表面现象和主题，而"punctum"则是照片中的某个具体元素或细节，能够引起观看者强烈的共鸣和感觉。他认为，照片的意义取决于观看者对它们的理解和感受，不同的观看者可能会从同一张照片中感受到不同的东西。

总之，"Camera Lucida"是一本关于照片的哲学性著作，探讨了照片的本质、意义和影响，是一本值得深入阅读和思考的书籍。

Keywords:

### “[Encoding/Decoding](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/262179/topics/8324064)” by Stuart Hall

"Encoding/Decoding" 是斯图尔特·霍尔（Stuart Hall）在 1973 年提出的一种通信模型，用于分析媒体和信息的交流过程。这个模型将媒体的信息传递过程分为两个方面，分别是编码和解码。

编码是指媒体制作和传输信息的过程。在编码的过程中，媒体使用符号、语言和图像等来传达信息，并将其制作成一个可被传输和传播的形式。这个过程中，媒体的信息是由具有某种特定文化背景和意识形态的人员所制作的，这种文化背景和意识形态会影响信息的制作和传播。

解码则是指信息接收者接收信息并进行理解和解释的过程。在解码的过程中，信息接收者根据自己的文化背景、意识形态、经验和价值观等因素来理解信息，这些因素也会影响他们对信息的理解和解释。

霍尔认为，在信息交流的过程中，编码和解码是相互关联的，并受到文化和社会背景的影响。他指出，如果接收者和制作者的文化和价值观相同，那么信息的解码可能与编码相同，但如果不同，解码和编码可能会有很大的差异，导致信息的误解或被忽视。

因此，霍尔的 "Encoding/Decoding" 模型强调了媒体和信息传播中的文化和社会因素对信息解码的影响，呼吁我们在接收和理解信息时，要对其进行批判性的思考，了解信息背后的文化和价值观，并不断探究和反思信息的真实意义。

### “[Cinematography: The Creative Use of Reality](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/262179/topics/8324069)” by Maya Deren

summary:

Maya Deren's "Cinematography: The Creative Use of Reality" is a collection of essays and lectures on the art of filmmaking, written by one of the pioneers of avant-garde cinema. In this book, Deren explores the ways in which filmmakers can use the medium of film to create works of art that are both true to reality and yet transcendent.

The central theme of the book is the idea that cinema is not simply a tool for capturing reality, but a means of creating it. Deren argues that filmmakers can use the camera to manipulate time, space, and motion in order to express their own vision of the world. She emphasizes the importance of the filmmaker's creative control over the visual and aural elements of the film, and the need for a careful balance between the objective reality of the camera and the subjective reality of the filmmaker's imagination.

Deren also discusses the importance of rhythm and movement in cinema, and the ways in which filmmakers can use these elements to create a sense of timelessness and transcendence. She explores the concept of the "**vertical axis**" in film, which refers to the way in which images can be stacked on top of one another to create a sense of depth and complexity.

Overall, "Cinematography: The Creative Use of Reality" is a passionate and insightful exploration of the art of filmmaking, written by one of its most visionary practitioners. Deren's ideas about the creative potential of cinema continue to inspire filmmakers and film lovers alike to this day.

### “[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/262179/topics/8324072)” by Laura Mulvey

"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" is a seminal essay by feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey, published in 1975. In the essay, Mulvey argues that classical Hollywood cinema reinforces patriarchal structures by presenting women as objects of male desire, rather than active subjects. She calls this the "male gaze," which she defines as the perspective of a heterosexual male viewer that objectifies and fetishizes the female characters on screen.

Mulvey suggests that this is achieved through the use of techniques such as close-ups, slow-motion, and the voyeuristic camera, which invite the male viewer to identify with the male protagonist and to view the female character as a passive object to be looked at. This leads to the construction of the female character as a "to-be-looked-at-ness," a term Mulvey coins to describe the fetishistic quality of the female image in classical Hollywood cinema.

Mulvey argues that this construction of the female character perpetuates the patriarchal ideology of male superiority and female subordination, and she calls for a new kind of cinema that challenges this patriarchal structure by representing women as active subjects and by subverting the dominant gaze. She suggests that this can be achieved through the use of experimental techniques that disrupt the narrative flow of classical Hollywood cinema, and that create a new kind of visual language that challenges the dominant gaze.

Overall, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" is an influential essay that has had a profound impact on feminist film theory and has contributed to a wider understanding of the ways in which cinema shapes and reflects social and cultural norms.

consider discuss an object

**Mid Term Paper Assignment: Object Lesson**

Assignment Directions: For the mid-term assignment, you are tasked with inhabiting the perspective of a technology, tool, or media object of your choice. Consider this a slightly different take on Latour’s *becoming-other*. I want you to describe the kind of knowledge that your object produces, including how it affords certain knowledge production and constraints other forms. What does your object reveal or enframe?  What sorts of relations and systems does your object engender? How do those relationships change your object, or how does your object change the things it is in relation to? To whom or what is it connected, and why? How does your object relate to power in society, if at all? This is an exercise in what I call “critical description,” as it is both a practice of description but requires you to demonstrate analytical skills through the ways you describe your object and its related histories, systems, relations, etc. Consider the various perspectives on technology and media we have explored so far this semester and use these perspectives to guide your exploration of your object. This paper is intended to be written as a description, but your analysis will shine through in how you choose to represent your object and the kinds of thing you demonstrate about the object. To do this, you must use 3-5 terms or concepts from readings we have encountered as a class. Terms and concepts should be deployed appropriately and toward understanding your object. Define terms and concepts include relevant quotes where appropriate. Note: though the inclusion of these terms and concepts might appear odd while inhabiting the perspective of an iPhone, say, but I am giving you free range to anthropomorphize and to suspend disbelief in this act of critical role-play/empathy.

A successful paper will do each of the following:

1. Demonstrate understanding of the chosen object. Its materiality, its technological composition (to some degree), its history, the systems it is embedded in, etc. Provide adequate and interesting description.
2. Demonstrate understanding of terms from the course and successfully integrate terms and concepts relevant to the chosen object. Provide analysis of the object via the deployment of these terms and their relation to the description.
3. Present a well written, well organized submission that effectively responds to the prompt.
4. Embraces the creativity of the assignment.

In “How Media Became New,” how did Manovich describe the relationship between old (mass media) and new (computing) media?

“New Media represents a convergence of two separate but parallel historical trajectory – development of mass media technologies and computing.”

Cinema – the history of modern mass media of storage [of discretely sampled visual data].

> Cinema (film camera/film reels) as recording and storing visible DATA in material form (p24)
> 

Film projector as a machine that can read the data and output it as something else.

> The Universal Turing Machine is a kind of film camera and film projector at once, reading instructions and data stored on endless tape and writing them on this tape. The development of a suitable storage medium and a method for coding data represent important parts of the prehistory of both cinema [celluloid] and computer [binary code]. (Manovich 24)
> 

1. Numerical Representation

Media becomes programmable, and can be algorithmically manipulated.

“New media” as media processing: sampling media (continuous data) into **discrete**, numerical data accessible through computers

1. Modulality of New Media
- New media has a consistent modular structure: pixels, characters, codes, scripts…
- These discrete samples are assembled into large-scaled objects but maintain their separate identities.
- Modularity in computer programming refers to the separation of the functionality in a program into distinct and independent units such that every unit has everything required for it (self-sufficient) to execute just that aspect of the program.

1. automation of media
- The numerical coding and modular structures of a media object allow for the emergence of a language/semantics of new media
- Some “language uses” are conventionalized into commercial software and achieve ”low-level” automation.
- The development of Artificial Intelligence requires a “high-level” automation where the computer can understand the meanings embedded behind these programing languages (rather than just execute them)
- Does “new media” lead us to the irreversible path of automation then?

a need to find more efficient ways to classify and search media objects

word processors

image search

“variability” and “transcoding”.

1. Variability of new media

> A new media text/object is not something fixed ocnce and for all, it can exist in different, potentially infinite versions generated by a computer. These variations are not only products of human creators but also of digital processing. (p36)
> 

What are some of the usage of media deriving from the concept of “variability”?

- User customization - the user is given many options to modify and tailor the performance of a program or an object;
- Open/closed interactivity

Variability: modeling the world as variables

> The principle can also be seen as a consequence of the computer’s way of representing data --  and modeling the world itself – as variables rather than constants. (p43)
> 

1. culture/computer transcoding

New media consists of **the cultural layer** (content, cultural norms etc) and **the computer layer** (interface, data structure). They are being composited together and influence each other

Anyone recall Gitelman’s delivery systems + cultural protocol definition? How is Manovich’s idea different from Gitelman?

Our culture is in the process of being **transcoded** by the computer’s language, interface, and structure. Simultaneously, the computational languages also in turn reshape how we see the world.

periodic updates

intro: Despite year-old promises to fix its “Up Next” content recommendation system, YouTube is still suggesting conspiracy 阴谋 videos, hyperpartisan 超派 and misogynist 厌女 videos, pirated videos 盗版, and content from hate groups following common news-related searches.

Researchers have described YouTube as “[the great radicalizer.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html)”

In the end, what’s clear is that YouTube’s recommendation algorithm isn’t a partisan monster — it’s an engagement monster. It’s why its recommendations veer unpredictably from cable news to pirated reality shows to QAnon conspiracy theories. Its only governing ideology is to wrangle content — no matter how tenuously linked to your watch history — that it thinks might keep you glued to your screen for another few seconds.

最后，有一点很清楚: YouTube 的推荐算法不是一个党派怪物，而是一个参与度怪物。这就是为什么它的建议从有线新闻到盗版真人秀再到 QAnon 阴谋论变化莫测的原因。它唯一的主导思想是争论内容ーー不管它与你的手表历史有多么微弱的联系ーー它认为这些内容可能会让你再盯着屏幕几秒钟。

**Title:** There is No Algorithm for Truth - with Tom Scott

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leX541Dr2rU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leX541Dr2rU)

Hook:

Imagine a machine learning system(experiment) that can tell fact, truth…

Less recommendation of yt videos, more true answers

?: the result produced is what you find abhorrent

Eg: 2019 a no-deal Brexit

Objective truth vs individual fundamental core values

- compromise
- shout out

Science communication and broadcast communication

Parasocial relationship- odd, one-way relationships

Algorithm

- Recommend videos for you

(interesting opinion about the number of subscribers)

Not a particularly useful metric

More a function of how long you’ve been on the platform

&how many one hit wonders you’ve had

Take self as an example: spent 15 years before something(science communication) worked

One conflict of interest note

Company, uploader, google

Part 1 of 5: The Algorithm

Concept:

- a collection of machine learning systems
- A magical black box of code
- Provide categorization system
- Learn from feedback

Yt use a machine learning system to try and detect

- whether videos are suitable for the view
- Whether videos are suitable for ads to place

Yt a human lifetime review,cause every day lot of videos are uploaded.

Yt CEO’s words in an interview:

Highest paid yt stars(top10): all male

How does the system work/comment on the videos and viewers?

- White? Man?
- Watch the whole video or not?

“When’s metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Goodhart’s Law

(The change of target changes people’s mind and original individual mode of making videos.)

Reward list of videos

Google Brian:

One of the key is to generalize

Be able to see similar but not exactly the same

(Funny thing that when he talks about google would broadcast adverts to people who are more tolerant to them, the video enters into the mid advert. Am I a person who is tolerant to adverts??)

Big companies’ idea: every advert is perfectly targeted to you.

Companies avoid to give information away to avoid audience’s finding opportunities

(Tom’s opinion: random)

Solution? No.

Only about finding a balance.

About finding at the least worst option.

Impossible to find a platform that is all clickbait or no clickbait(点击诱饵).

(Q: why the lecturer’s mention of adverts are all negative?? From my personal perspective, adverts are not a complete bad thing. It has practical significant. )

Never a hard core for the google algorithm

(Sounds like the algorithm is set on the one hand for the viewers current interests, on the other hand helps explore the viewers’ interests by analyzing the data of similar users or whatever. )

“Authoritative voice”(McOwen Wilson)

( the algorithm is the tool of the government or big companies in order to control the thoughts of public ??)

( fake data( fake view number etc.

Dozens of questions and examples…

Platforms tell you what to do in whichever direction

But...how do we define the authority ??

Part 2 of 5: The State of Science Communication

Science communication is with many men back up who are all authority with BBC back them up.

How to get the person less qualified but more known to the audience?

Instead of the perfect person for the job.

Eg. Sister Wendy

her degree is not an art history but the audience like her.

The New Yorker: “Her insightful, unscripted commentaries, connected emotionally with millions in Britain and America.”

Just trust them-the thing that the audience wants (skeptical… sure it’s not wise to over-valuate the audience, but I can bet that not all of them are fools.

People’s time spending(stay and leave) on the video: (up to 120%)(?

Reason:

- Some go back and watch a bit again
- Yt’s graphing API

Two big drop-off: beginning and end

Make money when it is coming in, “make hay when the sun shines”

...Cause after a couple of weeks, it is all gone away. (The internet’s fish-like memory…:(

Example of a music band

Explain that you need the opportunity to become the lucky one

500 minutes of videos that are not watched are uploaded every minute

Part 3 of 5 Parasocial

Previous/ outdated method: voice message. Phonecall

The opportunity of receiving responses and attention from the uploader

The thought of the audience: This should exist and I should donate money to this

So, it’s people choose to support them

“Selling friendship”

“Emotional labour”

The emotional  connection between the creator and fans can be the key in converting a fan to a patron.

Distinction between a fan of X’s work and a fan of X

Talking to the audience are different from talking to the viewers.

Part 4 of 5 Echo Chambers and Nazi Bars

(I do not quite understand this part…

Part 5 of 5 There Is No Algorithm For Truth

Think more + long term profits

They do understand things like public relations… and know how to work them out

From humanities perspective, the ideal algorithm would be helping humanity to survive long term

It would suppress conspiracy theories and fake news

Hope the goal is not to maximize the profit of one company

We are that system.

It’s up to us who create things.

### March 27 pre platform capitalism

**Unit 3 New Media Economy**

**In this unit, we will look at how the formal and informal economies of media/data.**

Week 9 Platform Capitalism

1101 Nick Srnicek, excerpt from “[Chapter 2: Platform Capitalism](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19WO3jqGjlGSs7SyZ6Bfa5TiUm4DSmaLq/view?usp=sharing)*.”* 2016, 36-50.

One: Labor process and products of work: immaterial; material commodities contain an increas- ing amount of knowledge, which is embodied in them

Other side: the economy today is dominated by a new class, which does not own the means of production but rather has ownership over information.

Key argument: In the twenty-first century advanced capitalism came to be centred upon extracting and using a particular kind of raw material: data.

Data (information that something happened) vs. knowledge (information about why something happened)

data have come to serve a number of key capitalist functions

The new business model that eventually emerged is a powerful new type of firm: the platform.

Platforms became an efficient way to monopolise, extract, analyse, and use the increasingly large amounts of data that were being recorded’

What are platforms?

- Generally, digital infrastructures that enable two or more groups to interact.
- intermediaries that bring together different users: customers, advertisers, service providers, producers, suppliers, and even physical objects.
- come with a series of tools
- a platform positions itself (1) between users, and (2) as the ground upon which their activities occur, which thus gives it privileged access to record them.
- they can operate anywhere, wherever digital interaction takes place.
- second essential characteristic: digital platforms produce and are reliant on ‘network effects’
- the third characteristic – platforms often use cross-subsidisation:
- Finally, platforms are also designed in a way that makes them attractive to its varied users. they in fact embody a politics.

Platforms, in sum, are a new type of firm; they are characterised by providing the infrastructure to intermediate between different user groups, by displaying monopoly tendencies driven by network effects, by employing cross-subsidisation to draw in different user groups, and by having a designed core architecture that governs the interaction possibilities. Platform ownership, in turn, is essentially ownership of software (the 2 billion lines of code for Google, or the 20 million lines of code for Facebook) and hardware (servers, data centres, smart- phones, etc.), built upon open-source material (e.g. Hadoop’s data management system is used by Facebook). All these characteristics make platforms key business models for extracting and controlling data. By providing a digital space for others to interact in, platforms position them- selves so as to extract data from natural processes (weather conditions, crop cycles, etc.), from pro- duction processes (assembly lines, continuous flow manufacturing, etc.), and from other busi- nesses and users (web tracking, usage data, etc.). They are an extractive apparatus for data. (48)

summary by chat gpt:

In the Atlas of AI, Kate Crawford examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on different aspects of society, including labor. She argues that AI is fundamentally changing the nature of work and employment, and this change is driven by the deployment of algorithms and automated systems that can perform tasks previously done by humans.

Crawford discusses how AI is being used in various industries to replace human workers, from manufacturing to service jobs. She highlights how this automation is not only eliminating jobs but also leading to a growing precarity of work, with many workers being forced into low-paid and unstable positions.

Furthermore, she examines how AI is creating new forms of work, such as the gig economy, where workers are not classified as employees but as independent contractors. This shift in work arrangements is leading to a lack of social protections for workers, such as sick leave, health insurance, and retirement benefits.

Crawford argues that the use of AI in labor is also exacerbating existing inequalities and biases in the workforce, including racial and gender discrimination. She notes that algorithms can perpetuate these biases if they are trained on biased data or if their design is influenced by discriminatory practices.

Overall, Crawford highlights the urgent need for policymakers, workers, and companies to address these issues and ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit society as a whole, rather than exacerbating existing inequalities and undermining the rights of workers.

已改过的chatgpt

In “introduction” from "Protocol” by Alexander Galloway, ways in which digital networks are changing the nature of power and control are discussed. By examining the history of the internet, Galloway points out that it is changing from a decentralized network that could withstand attacks and disruptions to a centralized one, with a few platforms controlling most of the data flows. Galloway thinks that this centralization of power has led to new forms of control. This new form of control, he introduces the concept of “protocol”. He defines protocol as "a set of recommendations and rules that outline specific technical standards” (Galloway 6) Galloway then gives several examples like online games and music to show how protocols are used to control and shape digital networks. In conclusion, Galloway suggests that understanding protocols is key to understanding how digital networks operate and how we can resist the new forms of control that they enable.

### “[Cyborg Manifesto](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/262179/topics/8324285)” by Donna Haraway

"Cyborg Manifesto" by Donna Haraway is a highly influential essay that challenges traditional notions of gender, identity, and technology. Here is a summary of the key ideas in the essay:

Haraway introduces the concept of the cyborg as a hybrid figure that transcends traditional boundaries of gender, race, and class. The cyborg is portrayed as a powerful symbol of resistance against oppressive systems of categorization and domination.

Haraway argues that traditional categories such as "woman" are problematic because they are based on fixed identities and binary oppositions. She proposes that the cyborg, with its fluid and flexible nature, can serve as a new framework for understanding identity and embodiment.

Haraway also discusses the intersections of technology, biology, and culture. She argues that technology is not external to us, but rather an integral part of our lives and bodies. She calls for a rethinking of the relationship between humans and machines, and a rejection of the dichotomy between nature and culture.

Furthermore, Haraway critiques the notion of universal feminism, pointing out that it often reinforces white, middle-class, heterosexual perspectives. She advocates for intersectional feminism that recognizes the complexities of identity and the need to challenge multiple systems of oppression.

Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto" has been influential in feminist theory, science and technology studies, and posthumanism, challenging conventional notions of identity and advocating for a more inclusive and fluid understanding of gender, technology, and social relations. Overall, the essay encourages readers to question traditional categories and boundaries, and to embrace the possibilities of hybridity, multiplicity, and complexity in understanding the contemporary world.

In "Introduction" from Information Activism, Cait McKinney sets the stage for the book, exploring the intersection of information and activism. She notes that digital technologies have created new possibilities and challenges for activists and highlights the importance of understanding the materiality of information technologies.

McKinney focuses on the historical role of lesbian feminist groups in information activism, such as the Lesbian Herstory Archives and the Combahee River Collective. She argues that these groups understood the importance of preserving and disseminating information about lesbian culture and history, and that their approaches to information activism provide valuable insights for contemporary activists.

The Introduction concludes by outlining the main themes and arguments of the book, including the ways in which information can be used to challenge power, the role of affect and emotion in information activism, and the importance of intersectional approaches to understanding information activism.

### “[A Trans Historiography of Glitches and Errors](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/262179/topics/8277285)” by Whit Pow

from chatgpt and adjusted

In this essay, Powell discusses the ways in which the experiences of transgender people can be understood through the metaphor of glitches and errors. Powell argues that the experience of being transgender can be described as ametaphor of glitch or error within the dominant social and cultural systems that rely on binary notions of gender and could be expressed by glitch art.

Powell starts with the first piece of experimental video glitch art, Digital TV Dinner. And then he traces the historical context of transgender experience, discussing the ways in which transgender people have been pathologized, marginalized, and excluded from mainstream society. Powell notes that the medicalization of transgender identity has often led to harmful and stigmatizing treatments, and that the lack of recognition of transgender people's identities has contributed to high rates of violence and discrimination. Powell argues that these glitches and errors reveal the limitations and inadequacies of these systems, and that they provide opportunities for resistance and transformation.
Furthermore, Powell suggests that the metaphor of glitches and errors can be used to understand the ways in which transgender people have historically engaged in acts of resistance and subversion. Powell discusses the ways in which transgender people have used humor, performance, and other strategies to disrupt dominant gender norms and challenge the social and cultural systems that exclude them.

In conclution, Powell thinks its importatn to recognize the experiences of transgender people as legitimate and valuable contributions to our understanding of the human experience. He argues that the metaphor of glitches and errors provides a powerful view to understand the experiences of transgender people and to challenge dominant social and cultural systems.

### “Introduction” and “Default Discrimination” from [*Race after Technology](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/le/lessons/262179/topics/8324390)* by Ruha Benjamin

summary from chatGPA

Introduction:
The introduction sets the stage for the book, highlighting how technology is not neutral, but rather a product of social, historical, and cultural forces that can perpetuate or challenge existing systems of inequality. The author argues that race and technology are intertwined, and that technological innovations often reinforce racial hierarchies and biases. Benjamin introduces the concept of "default discrimination," which refers to how discriminatory practices become embedded into technology and are perpetuated by default settings, programming algorithms, and design choices. She also emphasizes the importance of examining the impact of technology on marginalized communities and calls for a critical analysis of the ways in which technology can both reproduce and challenge racial inequalities.

Default Discrimination:
In this chapter, Benjamin delves deeper into the concept of default discrimination, arguing that discriminatory practices are not always intentional, but rather can be embedded into technological systems through design choices, biases, and assumptions. She highlights how default settings in technology often prioritize and center the needs and perspectives of dominant groups, while marginalizing or excluding those who do not fit the default norm. Benjamin presents several examples of default discrimination in various domains such as facial recognition technology, predictive policing, and hiring algorithms, where biases and discriminatory practices are perpetuated by technology. She also discusses the limitations of current approaches to addressing default discrimination, such as diversity and inclusion initiatives, and calls for a deeper understanding of the ways in which technology can reinforce or challenge existing systems of racial inequality.

Overall, the "Introduction" and "Default Discrimination" chapters of "Race after Technology" provide a critical examination of the complex relationship between race and technology, and highlight how discriminatory practices can become embedded into technological systems, perpetuated by default settings and design choices. The author calls for a more nuanced understanding of the impact of technology on marginalized communities and the need for a critical analysis of the ways in which technology can reinforce or challenge existing systems of racial inequality.

historiography

> Aggregating these often separate historical lineages has the potential to enrich the disparate disciplinary knowledges that are bound together here. Media scholars, for example, can learn to read their histories in archaeological ruins, and urban historians and archaeologists can better appreciate the centrality of communication and media history to their own fields. Thinking these histories in tandem also reveals the long history and expansive geography of urban mediation (see Mattern 2015b: 96). Particularly in light of recent attempts to understand what kinds of intelligence are embodied in our digital “smart cities,” the comparatively “dumb” histories of mud and mark-making demonstrate that calculation, coding, and embedded technologies have long been integral to our cities’ infrastructures (315)
