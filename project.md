## Brainstorming of Algos

- algo 1: steam: store recommendations, sales/discounts during festivals; ads
- algo 2: the RED, the recommendations according to what people around you are searching, is it keeping monitoring? why the simplist or most recognized algorithm is assuming that people who is under the same wifi signal with you (or geographically around you) like is what you might like? and the contact like? how the percent of ads in the recommendations are defined or growing?
- **algo 3: Taobao ~~/Alibaba~~ (e-commerce):**
    - **the pop-up windows added to all other softwares, people are getting annoying but they entertained this so how we praise or criticize the promotion? are the pop-up ads all the same in different apps or has algorithm inside? according to what, the user or the platform? each time when the other software opens, the ads would refresh and pop-up a new one, is there algorithm inside?**
    - search pages algorithm,
    - filterings, the re-ranking according to different
    - main page recommendations,
    - popularity and trending analysis
- algo 4: matchmaking in online co-op games

## A Reserach Question?
How do users perceive and respond to algorithm-driven pop-up ads from Taobao, and what folk theories do they hold about the personalization and targeting mechanisms behind these ads?

whether they change behavior in Taobao

    - This article analyzes how users perceive algorithms through the lens of "folk theories" based on a Norwegian survey. It identifies five folk theories about algorithms being confining, practical, reductive, intangible, and exploitative. A key point is that digital irritation, rather than resignation, often arises from algorithmic interactions, which could inspire future resistance against datafication

    1. Perceived Intrusiveness and Task Disruption:
   - Pop-up ads are found to be significantly more intrusive than in-line ads. This intrusiveness leads to negative attitudes toward both the ads and the advertiser. The study suggests that this disruptiveness stems from the forced attention and interruption of user tasks.
   - In contrast, in-line ads, which are embedded within the content, tend to be less disruptive and more favorably received.
    2. Cognitive Load and User Experience:
   - Pop-up ads impose a higher cognitive load on users, negatively affecting their ability to complete tasks efficiently. The study explores the psychological consequences of this, including frustration and diminished user satisfaction.
    3. Implications for Advertisers:
   - The findings highlight the trade-off advertisers face between grabbing attention (with intrusive pop-ups) and maintaining a positive user experience. Intrusive ads may achieve short-term visibility but can harm long-term brand perception and user trust.
    4. Behavioral Responses to Ads:
   - Users often react to pop-ups with immediate avoidance behaviors, such as closing or blocking the ads, reflecting their active aversion to such formats. This contrasts with more passive engagement seen with in-line ads.
    5. Design Recommendations:
   - The study advocates for ad designs that balance visibility with minimal user disruption. 

## Planning the Research
1. Question: define your research perimeter + questions YOU are interested in.

    **Research Perimeter**: The research aims to explore folk theories (perceptions and experiences) with algorithm-driven pop-up ads(windows) from Taobao, focusing on ads(windows) both in Taobao and other third-party applications.

    **Questions**:  
    - **User Awareness**: Do users think/view these ads as personalized or random, and what folk theories(perceptions and experiences) do they hold/have about how the ads are selected?
   - **Relevance**: How relevant do users feel these ads are to their interests, and what factors do they believe influence this relevance (e.g., usage behavior, app context)?
   - **Behavioral Influence**: To what extent do these pop-up ads impact user actions, in purchasing decisions or avoidance of certain apps?
   - **Privacy Concerns**: Do users feel that these pop-ups are invasive, and what are their attitudes toward the transparency of ad algorithms?
2. Who are you interested in? Where to go, and from whom, the material can be obtained?

    **Possible interviewee**: frequent users of Taobao and third-party apps and individuals who encounter Taobao’s pop-up ads, online shopping lover (online or in-person)

    **Possible places**: the place i can find chinese people...

    **Possible material**:..

3. Interview guide: a list of 5-7 topics you will talk about with your interlocutors. An interview guide is not a questionnaire, it’s a set of themes to guide your discussion.

## ~~Questionnaire~~ Interview Guide
general experience -> content and perception -> algorithmic influence -> personal impact and behavioral changes -> privacy concerns -> overall evaluation -> others

Period 1: General Experience
1. ~~Do you use Taobao?~~

### 00:16 - 00:45 — Introduction + 00:46 - 01:20 — Research Context/Reason [167 words]
Hello everyone, welcome to the new episode of "SuperNova, algorithms beyond us" podcast series, where we explore the fascinating world of algorithms—I am focusing, specifically, on the Taobao fullscreen banner ad showing up on the launching page of other apps. 

If you live in China, or you are using some Chinese apps, you will find Taobao fullscreen ads are everywhere on other Chinese apps such as Weibo, the community app or Wangyi, an email app. Acting as one of the most intrusive forms of digital advertising, these ads don’t wait for your input; they don’t need a search bar, filters, or any user action—they just jump out at you, demanding your attention at the moment you open apps. This makes them stand out among other algorithms with the highest level of activeness. 
But how do users actually experience these ads? What do they think about them? And what does this tell us about the folk's relationship with algorithms? In this episode, we’ll try to find some answers.

### 01:21 - 01:50 — User Experience Overview [72 words]
When I interviewed users about these ads, an interesting trend emerged: most didn’t pay attention to them. One interviewee even said, 'xxxxx' (e.g., 'I never let the loading window finish. I always skip it before the ad fully appears. I use the 3 seconds to daze. Honestly, I never really notice what’s being advertised.'). This highlights a kind of passive resistance to these intrusive ads, where users simply bypass them whenever possible.

### 01:51 - 02:40 — Excerpt 1: User Reaction<br>
But not everyone totally ignores these ads. One interviewee described herself as 'rebellious' in her reaction to those banners. 'xxxxx' (e.g., 'Whenever I see these ads, I feel like they’re forcing me into something. It actually makes me trust the product less. xxxxx').

//

This reaction aligns with a psychological phenomenon known as 'reactance.' The Forced Exposure Theory explains that when people feel coerced or manipulated, they push back, sometimes by rejecting the message or product entirely. It’s fascinating how such strong resistance can emerge from something as simple as an ad.

### 02:41 - 02:55 — Transition
To dig deeper, I asked this interviewee if her feelings would change if Taobao made the algorithm behind these ads more transparent. After some hesitation, she responded: 'xxxxx' (e.g., 'I don’t know... even if they told me how it works, I’d probably still doubt the product.').

### 02:56 - 04:20 — Analysis: Forced Exposure & Findings
This hesitation reveals a deeper issue. It’s not just the presence of the ad but the way it violates the Sense of Boundary between the user and the algorithm. Users feel offended when algorithms act too aggressively or assume too much control, breaking the subtle balance between active and passive engagement.

Research on Forced Exposure and Psychological Reactance shows that this perceived intrusion can lead to negative emotions, distrust, and even rebellion. And this ties back to the concept of 'folk theories'—informal explanations users create to make sense of algorithmic behavior. These theories shape how users interpret their experiences, and when an algorithm crosses an invisible boundary, it disrupts their trust and comfort with the platform.

This is why, even with transparency, the sense of being controlled or manipulated by an ad can persist, affecting how users engage with the platform and even the advertised products."

### 04:21 - 05:00 — Conclusion + Outro
In conclusion, Taobao’s fullscreen banner ads illustrate the tension between algorithmic effectiveness and user satisfaction. While these ads may grab attention, their intrusive nature can provoke resistance and distrust, shaping how users perceive both the platform and its products.

So, how do we strike a balance? How can algorithms respect user boundaries while achieving their goals? Thanks for joining me on this exploration—until next time!
