## brainstorming of algos

- algo 1: steam: store recommendations, sales/discounts during festivals; ads
- algo 2: the RED, the recommendations according to what people around you are searching, is it keeping monitoring? why the simplist or most recognized algorithm is assuming that people who is under the same wifi signal with you (or geographically around you) like is what you might like? and the contact like? how the percent of ads in the recommendations are defined or growing?
- **algo 3: Taobao ~~/Alibaba~~ (e-commerce):**
    - **the pop-up windows added to all other softwares, people are getting annoying but they entertained this so how we praise or criticize the promotion? are the pop-up ads all the same in different apps or has algorithm inside? according to what, the user or the platform? each time when the other software opens, the ads would refresh and pop-up a new one, is there algorithm inside?**
    - search pages algorithm,
    - filterings, the re-ranking according to different
    - main page recommendations,
    - popularity and trending analysis
- algo 4: matchmaking in online co-op games

## A reserach question?
How do users perceive and respond to algorithm-driven pop-up ads from Taobao, and what folk theories do they hold about the personalization and targeting mechanisms behind these ads?

## Keywords
