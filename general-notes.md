### Chew on it!Ôºå Chiara Torterolo

Chew on it! - Sum up üñáÔ∏è

We‚Äôll use chewing gum as a creative medium 
for exploration. 
In groups, you will work on new chewing gum ideas *turning experiences, functions, desires, inspirations into bold new forms, flavors, textures that will redefine the way we enjoy it*.

Any idea is welcome, we will discuss them together!

At 4pm you should send here in the chat a HR .jpg ,as the following example. Here more details:
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Digital image, collage, render, etc..
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Landscape format 1920 x 1080
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Background color #ededed
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Named: Group n¬∞- @insta_@insta_@insta.jpg

Have fun! üéà

Brainstorming:
- characteristic of the material
- acid coat 
- superpower
- release pressure
- looks rigid, hard, but taste soft, discussing the softness

*NO PAIN Chewing Gum*

‚ÄúBreak the tension.  No pain,  just the sweet release.‚Äâ"

Our NO PAIN Chewing Gum redefines the act of chewing as a reflection of modern life‚Äôs challenges, offering a deliberate interplay of tension and relief. Designed for individuals navigating high-pressure environments, it provides a small yet meaningful moment to pause, reset, and restore balance amidst the demands of daily life.

At first bite, the gum‚Äôs polished, firm outer shell resists, mimicking the rigidity of external pressures. This resistance is intentional, symbolizing resilience and strength. As the shell cracks open, it reveals a soft, creamy core that releases a sweet, tangy liquid, creating a surprising and soothing sensation. This transition from resistance to softness mirrors the emotional journey of breaking tension and finding calm. The flavor profile deepens this experience. The bold, sharp outer layer features notes of metallic citrus, such as yuzu or lime, paired with subtle mint undertones that awaken the senses. In contrast, the warm, sweet core, with hints of honey, chamomile, or vanilla, offers comfort and relaxation, leaving behind a lingering sense of calm and refreshment.

NO PAIN is a sensory experience crafted for those who value empowerment, self-care, and moments of surprise. Breaking through its outer shell becomes a symbolic act of overcoming challenges, while the melting core provides a sense of relief and emotional release. This gum transforms an everyday habit into a deliberate act of balance and renewal, offering a small yet profound reminder of the strength found in softness and the relief discovered through release.
