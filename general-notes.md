ethnographic research - ethnography

research project: how users of digital technologies interpret one specific algorithm

3 users, 4-5 audio podcast

bubble sort
information theory - whether a machine can think?
algorithm as an everyday notion: 

- ordering/filtering
- social negativation
- suggestions based on traces
- talking to machine
- text-to-image generators

Readings recommended (in zotero):
- Nick Seaver: Algorithms as culture: Some tactics for the ethnography of algorithmic systems
- Folk theories of algorithmic recommendations on Spotify: Enacting data assemblages in the global South Ignacio Siles1 , Andr es Segura-Castillo2, Ricardo Solı s3 and M onica Sancho3
    - consider more methods other than interview, let them draw or something,,
    - analyse the interviews 
    - study the folk theories of the algorithms you selected

Project Brief:

Chinese version: 算法解读项目简介

社交媒体发布顺序、类似Dall-E的文本生成图像工具、Spotify歌曲推荐、与Siri或Alexa的互动、自动门开启、火车座位分配……所有这些互动都由算法来调控。有些算法相当复杂，依赖于机器学习技术，而另一些则相对简单。然而，这些算法在我们日常生活中的作用越来越大。我们如何研究它们？我们如何调查它们的存在？它们对我们的社交生活有何影响？

方法：在这个个人项目中，每个人将选择一个服务，使用访谈方法来调查人们如何使用、反应、（尝试）理解或“欺骗”它。更具体地说，你将关注人们如何对这些算法形成/建立假设，他们如何认为算法运行的方式，以及他们如何“测试”它们并从中学到什么。

截至12月17日，准备一个5分钟的播客节目和一个10分钟的演示，描述你的发现（你研究的技术、方法，以及你从中得出的主要结论）。

# Project HERE

## brainstorming of algos

- algo 1: steam: store recommendations, sales/discounts during festivals; ads
- algo 2: the RED, the recommendations according to what people around you are searching, is it keeping monitoring? why the simplist or most recognized algorithm is assuming that people who is under the same wifi signal with you (or geographically around you) like is what you might like? and the contact like? how the percent of ads in the recommendations are defined or growing?
- **algo 3: Taobao ~~/Alibaba~~ (e-commerce):**
    - **the pop-up windows added to all other softwares, people are getting annoying but they entertained this so how we praise or criticize the promotion? are the pop-up ads all the same in different apps or has algorithm inside? according to what, the user or the platform? each time when the other software opens, the ads would refresh and pop-up a new one, is there algorithm inside?**
    - search pages algorithm,
    - filterings, the re-ranking according to different
    - main page recommendations,
    - popularity and trending analysis
- algo 4: matchmaking in online co-op games

## A reserach question?
How do users perceive and respond to algorithm-driven pop-up ads from Taobao, and what folk theories do they hold about the personalization and targeting mechanisms behind these ads?

## Keywords
Taobao, E-commerce, Algorithm, Pop-up advertisements, Folk theories
